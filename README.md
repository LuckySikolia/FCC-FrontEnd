This repository contains all the projects I have worked on as part of the front end certification by Free Code Camp

#Project one: Building a cat photo app in HTML.
This project helped me quickly grasp HTML basics in regards to layout, syntax, forms and links.

#Project two: Building a Cafe Menu with CSS.
This project helped me get the basics of css. Mainly external and internal styling and syntax.
